1.  mongoose.schema seems to coerce types into correct format such as Number to String.
2.  mongoose.schema , by default, sets field of type [elementaryType] (Array) to empty arr instead of undefined.
    To override this, set default value to undefined
3.  Ensure that you cast documents using correct TS interface using "as" when necessary
    Also, type cast id's of doc as mongoose.Types.ObjectId
